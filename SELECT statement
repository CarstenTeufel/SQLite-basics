--To get only two columns of the whole database, we do as follows

SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy FROM Country ORDER BY Name;

--As LifeExpectancy does not contain a space, we will obtain a different column name with an Alias. To add an alias, we do this:

SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy AS "Life Expectancy" FROM Country ORDER BY Name; --Mind the double quotes. As the alias has a space between, you will need the quotes. Without the space, it'll not run, as the code thinks it's two different strings. Single quotes is for literal strings

--To select rows from a table, we use the WHERE statement. In this case, we want all the rows with Europe in Continent

--To order it, we can use the ORDER clause. We will use the Limit Clause too, to limit results (first 5 rows)

--If I want the next 5, we use OFFSET
