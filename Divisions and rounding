SELECT 1 / 2; --Since all values are integers, the result will be an integer. This can be fixed as the following example tells
SELECT 1.0 / 2;
SELECT CAST (1 AS REAL) / 2; --Casting the operand as a Real number
SELECT 17 / 5;
SELECT 17 / 5, 17 % 5; --The percent sign will show the reminder of the division that does not end up in a integer, in this case 2.
